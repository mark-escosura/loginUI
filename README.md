Login UI with Flexbox

Objective

Create a visually appealing login user interface (UI) using HTML and CSS with Flexbox layout. The focus of this assignment is on styling and layout, so the UI does not need to be functional.

Requirements

    •	HTML and CSS only: Use these technologies to structure and style your login UI.
    •	Version Control: Push your project to a dedicated repository and submit the repository link for grading.
    •	Note: Each assignment should have its own repository. Please avoid combining multiple assignments in a single repo, as it can complicate the grading process.

Guidelines

    1.	Login Box Styling
    •	Ensure the login box has a minimum size to maintain consistent appearance.
    •	Use box-shadow for a subtle shadow effect and border-radius for rounded corners.
    •	Layout should be responsive and adaptive using Flexbox to center and align elements as shown in the provided example.
    2.	Form Inputs
    •	Include input fields for Username and Password with clear placeholder text.
    •	Text entered into the password field should be masked (shown as asterisks or circles).
    •	All input fields and text should be contained within the box without overflowing.
    3.	Button
    •	Include a button (e.g., “Submit” or “Log In”) styled to match the UI aesthetic.
